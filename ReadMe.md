Maturity: Alpha

## Project goals
* Replace `curl` as the best tool for Matrix operations tasks
* Make it easy to mutate rooms and their states
* No unintentional API calls
* Static webapp (cacheable, no backend needed)
* Mobile-first, but also nice on wider screens

## Roadmap
* API call history (planned)
* Dry-run mode (idea)
* Validation of state events before sending them (idea)
